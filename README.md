# movie-search-app

Movie search iPhone application that displays basic movie information (Title, poster, plot, rating, year, etc). Users could save movies queried through the OMDB API in an FM Database, and view saved movies in a separate favorites tab.

Note: This app was developed before the OMDB API was made private. Usage now requires becoming a patron of the API.
